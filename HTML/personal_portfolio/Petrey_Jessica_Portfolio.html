        <h3>Hobbies</h3> <!--add link to Etsy-->
        <p> I am an artist, my medium is wool - I make needle felted sculptures and large wall pieces. Just before beginning my
            CodingDojo bootcamp, I opened an <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/FeltByJess?ref=profile_header">Etsy shop</a>
            and listed my first macrame wall hanging! During the bootcamp I likely won't be able to do any felting, or listing on Etsy... 
            but I'm too excited about my upcoming adventures to be too distressed.</p><p>   Over the last year (ish), I'd been teaching myself 
            to code via <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> learning about the languages I listed above. I'm 
            interested in data analysis and dived into learning R, and was collecting my own data to work with - my barista job required 
            a clicker to count drinks made for the day, so I set up a Flic button that connected to our tablet via bluetooth and an IFTTT 
            protocol to add a row to a Google spreadsheet (on click) with timestamps. My goal was to make a viz showing the users our 
            busiest times of day, so they can choose the best time for them to grab a coffee. TBD, I still have the data, but was 
            unsuccessful in making a graph that included more than a single day's data. Maybe something I can complete when I graduate!
